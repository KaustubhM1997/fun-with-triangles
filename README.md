# Fun with Triangles
### About the App

This fun App created using Vanilla JS is intended to help the user learn about triangles in a fun way. The App consists of the following 4 sections:

1. **Is Triangle** - to check whether the angles a user inputs forms a triangle or not
2. **Triangle Quiz** - this consists of a set of questions that would test the user's understanding of some basic triangle properties
3. **Calculate Hypotenuse** - calculating the hypotenuse of a triangle when the user inputs the lengths of the other two sides
4. **Area of a Triangle** - this would calculate the area of a triangle when the user inputs the base and the height

The user can easily navigate through all these sections. 

### How does the App work?

The user would need to do the following: 

1. **Is Triangle** - Enter the 3 angles in the respective field and click on the check button whether those angles form a triangle
2. **Triangle Quiz** - Select one of the 3 options for a given question and click on the Check button to see your final score
3. **Calculate Hypotenuse** - Enter the length of the two sides of a triangle and Click on the Calculate button to find out the length of the Hypotenuse
4. **Area of a Triangle** - Input the length of the base and the height of a Triangle and then Click on Calculate Area to see the Area in square cm.
